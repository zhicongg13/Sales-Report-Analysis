   - Identify the top three regions with the highest and lowest customer counts. 

3. **Shipping Analysis**:
   - Determine the most popular shipment mode used by the company, shedding light on customer preferences.
   - Investigate whether the choice of shipment mode affects shipping dates, potentially influencing customer satisfaction.

4. **Product Analysis**:
   - Analyze the best-selling product categories in terms of quantity and sales amount.
   - Explore the sales trends of different product categories over the years and assess whether specific categories perform differently in various markets.

5. **Profit Analysis**:
   - Identify the top three countries generating the highest and negative profits for the company. 
   - Investigate product sub-categories that are yielding negative profits and determine the associated countries.
   - Analyze the relationship between sales and profits, assessing whether increased sales translate into higher profitability.
   - Determine whether there are regular customers who place at least 100 orders and evaluate their impact on overall profitability. 

Through these analyses, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the company's sales performance, customer behaviour, product trends, shipping efficiency, and profitability. The findings will guide strategic decision-making and help optimize various aspects of the business for future growth and success.
